PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a vector <int> S containing a set of pairwise distinct positive integers.

Return the size of the largest subset T of S such that any two numbers from T are relatively prime.

DEFINITION
Class:RelativelyPrimeSubset
Method:findSize
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int findSize(vector <int> S)


NOTES
-Two integers A and B are relatively prime if and only if their greatest common divisor equals to 1.


CONSTRAINTS
-S will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of S will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
-All elements in S will be distinct.


EXAMPLES

0)
{2,3,7,11,4}

Returns: 4

One such subset T is {2,3,7,11}, another is {3,4,7,11}.

1)
{4,8,12,16}

Returns: 1



2)
{100,17,81,82}

Returns: 3



3)
{2,3,4,5,6}

Returns: 3
