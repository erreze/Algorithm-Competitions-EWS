PROBLEM STATEMENT

You are given an int N.  The factorial of N is defined as N*(N-1)*(N-2)*...*1.  Compute the factorial of N and remove all of its rightmost zero digits.  If the result is more than K digits long, return the last K digits as a string.  Otherwise, return the entire result as a string.  


DEFINITION
Class:KLastNonZeroDigits
Method:getKDigits
Parameters:int, int
Returns:String
Method signature:String getKDigits(int N, int K)


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 1 and 20, inclusive.
-K will be between 1 and 9, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
10
3

Returns: "288"

You would first compute the factorial of 10, which is 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1=3628800. You would then remove all rightmost zeros to get 36288. Finally, you would return the last 3 digits as a string: "288".

1)
6
1

Returns: "2"

The factorial of 6 is 720.

2)
6
3

Returns: "72"



3)
7
2

Returns: "04"

The factorial of 7 is 5040. We remove the last zero to get "504". The last 2 digits of "504" are "04".

4)
20
9

Returns: "200817664"



5)
1
1

Returns: "1"
